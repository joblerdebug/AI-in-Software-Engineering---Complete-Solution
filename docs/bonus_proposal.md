# Bonus Task: AI-Powered Code Documentation Generator

## Tool Name: DocuGen AI

### Purpose
Automatically generate comprehensive, context-aware documentation for codebases, reducing documentation debt and improving maintainability.

### Problem Statement
Software teams spend significant time writing and maintaining documentation, which often becomes outdated as code evolves. DocuGen AI addresses this by automatically generating and updating documentation.

### Workflow

#### 1. Code Analysis Phase
```python
# Parse code structure, comments, and git history
- AST parsing for code structure analysis
- NLP processing of existing comments
- Git history analysis for change patterns
- Dependency mapping between components

# Comprehensive context comprehension
- Business logic inference from code patterns
- API endpoint detection and documentation
- Data flow analysis across components
- Architecture pattern recognition

# Multi-format documentation output
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Inline code comments and docstrings
- Architectural decision records (ADRs)
- User guides and tutorials
- Codebase overview and onboarding docs

# Ensure documentation accuracy
- Test case correlation analysis
- Code-documentation consistency checks
- Peer review integration
- Automated quality scoring

# Sync with code evolution
- Real-time documentation updates
- Change impact analysis
- Version-controlled documentation
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
